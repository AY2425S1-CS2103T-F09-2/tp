PlanPal is an **address book** designed for **student event planners** at NUS who need to manage contacts
(e.g., attendees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers) for their events.

PlanPal offers a **centralized platform** to organize, track, and access contact information, ensuring 
efficient coordination and smooth communication throughout the event planning process.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/ROLE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/attendee` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/ROLE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/attendee`, `r/attendee r/sponsor` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Specialized Searching Mode: `searchmode`/`sm`
Searchmode allows you to search for persons based on multiple criteria. 
You can search for persons based on any criteria including:
- Name
- Phone Number
- Email
- Address
- Telegram Handle
- Role

To Enter Searchmode, type `searchmode` or `sm` and press Enter. The display will then change to show the Searchmode interface.

![SearchModeUI.png](images%2FSearchModeUI.png)
Searchmode will display the list of all Contacts in PlanPal in the right blue panel (in the same way as the `list` command).
<br> The persons that match the search criteria (if any) will be displayed in the center panel.

The following commands can be used in Searchmode:
- `search` : Search for persons based on the criteria you specify.
- `exclude` : Exclude persons from appearing in searchmode
- `clearexcluded` : Clear all excluded persons
- `checkexcluded` : Check the list of excluded persons
- `exitsearch`/`es` : Exit searchmode and return to the normal display
- `help` : Display the help message 
- `exit`: Exit the program (same as the `exit` command)

### Searching in Searchmode `search`

Format: `search [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TELEGRAM_USERNAME] [r/ROLE]…​`


<Br>For each field, you can either specify multiple keywords _or_ multiple partial keywords
<Br>For example:
- `search n/Alex Yeoh` will return all persons whose name matches `Alex Yeoh` OR persons whose name contains `"Alex"`or 
`"Yeoh"`
![NameMatchCriteriaExample.png](images%2FNameMatchCriteriaExample.png)


<Br>With multiple fields search command will return all persons that match **ALL** the criteria you specify.
<Br>
Example:
- `search n/Alex Yeoh t/alexyeoh a/Blk` will return all persons 
whose:
  - name contains `Alex Yeoh`
  - telegram handle contains `alexyeoh` 
  - address contains `Blk`.
    ![SpecificSearchCriteria.png](images%2FSpecificSearchCriteria.png)

You can chain multiple searches to get the full list of persons you are looking for!
Example:
- Following up on the previous example, you can add more to the search list with more searches:
  - `search n/Char` will add people who have `Char` in their name to the list!
![ChainSearchExample1.png](images%2FChainSearchExample1.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If looking for a specific person, try to be as specific as possible to get the best results!
</div>

### Excluding persons from Searchmode `exclude`

Format: `exclude pi/INDEX [MORE_INDEXES]`

To get rid of persons from the search results, you can exclude them using the `exclude` command.
Note that excluded persons will not be displayed in all subsequent search results until they are cleared from the excluded list.

Example:
- `search n/Alex` returns a list of persons with the name `Alex`
  ![NameMatchCriteriaExample.png](images%2FNameMatchCriteriaExample.png)
- `exclude pi/2` will exclude the second person in the list from the search results
![ExcludeExample.png](images%2FExcludeExample.png)
- Subsequent searches will not include the excluded person in the search results
  - `search p/9234512` matches previously excluded person but will not reappear in l ist
![ExcludedSearchExample.png](images%2FExcludedSearchExample.png)

### Check excluded persons `checkexcluded`
To check the currently excluded persons in the search results, use the `checkexcluded` command.

Removed persons will be immediately added back to the list

Format: `clearexcluded`

Example:
![ClearExcludedExample.png](images%2FClearExcludedExample.png)

### Exiting Searchmode `exitsearch`/`es`
To exit searchmode and return to the normal display, use the `exitsearch` or `es` command.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Navigating through command history
The `up` and `down` arrow keys can be used to navigate through your command history. When you press the up arrow, the command box displays the previous commands you have executed, allowing you to re-run or edit past commands 
without retyping them. Pressing the down arrow lets you move forward through the command history, returning to more recent commands.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
